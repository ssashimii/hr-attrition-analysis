# HR Attrition Prediction (Python pandas / scikit-learn)


**Goal:** Build a reproducible pipeline that analyzes HR data, performs feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and trains simple baseline models to predict employee attrition. Interpret model results and provide actionable recommendations for HR.


## Dataset
The public **IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition** dataset is used. 


## Deliverables
- Cleaned dataset (in-notebook processing)
- EDA charts: attrition rates, distribution of key features, correlation heatmap
- Baseline models: Logistic Regression and Decision Tree
- Model evaluation: accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC-AUC
- Feature importance and short interpretation
- Business recommendations for HR based on findings
